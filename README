A simple TCP server template for Linux made following the Beej's guide to network programming.
The code currently has a simple echo server.
The server is handling connections by creating/detaching threads on each request.
The helper.h and helper.c contains various helper functions to abstract the network process.
Modify the handle segments of the server to suit your needs.
