A simple TCP server template for Linux made following the Beej's guide to network programming. The code currently has a simple echo server and client. The server is handling connections by creating/detaching threads. The helper.h/helper.c contains various helper functions to abstract the network process. Modify the handle segments of the server and client to suit your needs.
